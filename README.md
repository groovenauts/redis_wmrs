# redis_wmrs

There are some client libraries for [redis](http://redis.io/) on ruby.

https://rubygems.org/search?query=redis

[redis-sentinel](https://github.com/flyerhzm/redis-sentinel) works well
with redis and redis sentinel cluster. But it look up master node only.
Even if there are a lot of redis-servers, each redis client connect to
only one redis-server.


## Write master, Read slave

If you want to distribute the accesses from redis clients to master node,
your application should read data from slave node and write to master node.

RedisWmrs makes 2 redis-sentinel clients look 1 client.



## Background

### before using redis_wmrs

just only using redis-sentinel

![](https://cacoo.com/diagrams/5Rfve7mdSxEvMjwq-DFF4B.png)

GET and SET commands are sent to one master redis server only.


### after using redis_wmrs

![](https://cacoo.com/diagrams/5Rfve7mdSxEvMjwq-2B7B6.png)

GET commands are sent to each local redis server.
SET commands are sent to one master redis server only.


## Performance

We made a benchmark tool [redis_cluster_cache_benchmark](https://github.com/groovenauts/redis_cluster_cache_benchmark) for cache with a master-slave cluster.

see [a result](https://github.com/groovenauts/redis_cluster_cache_benchmark/tree/master/doc/vagrant02) for more detail


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'redis_wmrs'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install redis_wmrs

## Usage

Almost same as redis or redis-sentinel, but class name is not just Redis but RedisWmrs.

```

redis = RedisWmrs.new(
  :master_name => "sentinel_master",
  :sentinels => [
    {:host => "redis01", :port => 26379},
    {:host => "redis02", :port => 26379},
    {:host => "redis03", :port => 26379}
  ])

i = -1
while true
  i += 1
  i = 0 if i > 10
  redis.set("foo", Time.now.to_s) if i == 0

  header = "[#{Time.now.to_s}] sentinel:#{redis.client.current_sentinel.client.location} redis:#{redis.client.location}"
  begin
    puts "#{header} #{redis.get 'foo'}"
  rescue => e
    puts "#{header} [#{e.class.name}]: #{e.message}"
  end
  sleep 1
end

```
